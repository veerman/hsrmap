## About
I'm generally not a fan of bus schedules as I'd rather see the bus I want to catch on a map and simply hop on. If you like catching the bus the same way, this app is for you.

## Requirements
* PHP with composer

## Setup
* In root, run: composer install

## Notes
* live data isn't actually live, it's about 1 minute behind, so adjust accordingly
* if you click on the bus marker, you will see the route
