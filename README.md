## About
I am generally not a fan of bus schedules. I would rather see a visual representation of a bus location on a map, time my walk to the closest stop, and simply hop on my chosen bus. If you like catching the bus the same way, this app is for you. For more information on the creation of hsrmap, visit this [Software Hamilton article](http://www.softwarehamilton.com/2015/04/17/interview-with-steve-veerman-about-hsrmap/)

## API
See the API_README.md

## Requirements
* PHP with composer

## Setup
* In root, run: composer install

## Notes
* Live data is not actually live. It is about 45-75 seconds minute behind, so adjust accordingly.
* If you click on the bus marker, you will see the route drawn.
